# TRACKIFY
Bus tracking system

Bus Trackify is a cutting-edge project that utilizes GPS technology to provide a comprehensive 
and reliable bus tracking system. With the growing demand for efficient and convenient 
transportation for the students of the college, Bus Trackify aims to revolutionize the way buses 
are tracked and monitored. By collecting real-time location data from buses and applying 
advanced algorithms, Bus Trackify calculates and delivers estimated time of arrival (ETA) 
information for each bus stop along the bus route. This project has the potential to greatly 
enhance the public transportation experience for passengers, improve bus operations for 
operators, and optimize overall transportation networks.
